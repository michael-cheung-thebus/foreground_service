## 0.2.0

Add functions to check service started status & stop service

## 0.1.1+1

Slightly updated readme

## 0.1.1

Fix bug
(class would try to init Instant regardless of api level)

## 0.1.0+2

Try to fix wording. ("No" got left behind on a separate line, so it look liked it said
"iOS support planned" at a glance).

## 0.1.0+1

Typo

## 0.1.0

1st version.  Should suffice to take care of the simple case/bare necessities:
Change title, Change text, Change icon, Change priority,
and most importantly run a dart function within the context of a foreground service.
